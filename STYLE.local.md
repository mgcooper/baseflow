# Project-specific code style — bfra

Conventions specific to this project, extending the canonical `STYLE.md` (and any
language conventions merged into it). This file is project-owned — `--update` never
overwrites it.

## Naming

TODO: function/file name casing (e.g. camelCase vs snake_case vs lowercase), package
or namespace layout, variable casing, and any semantic variable prefixes.

## Formatting

TODO: indentation width, line length, how functions are closed, continuation style.

## Idioms and patterns

TODO: preferred patterns (vectorization, input parsing, optional outputs), key
libraries/toolboxes, and how new or risky code is staged.

## Other project conventions

TODO: anything else specific to this project — kernel conventions, argument-ordering
schemas, domain prefixes, etc. Delete this section if unused.

## Prose examples

Rewrite this:

> if nmin is set to 0 (and maybe if it is set to 1) this method will fail
> because runlength returns 1 for consecutive nan values, see isminlength.

as this:

> This method fails when nmin is 0, and possibly when nmin is 1. runlength
> returns 1 for consecutive nan values. See isminlength.
